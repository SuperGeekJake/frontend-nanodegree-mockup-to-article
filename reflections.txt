You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:

  * What new skills have you learned?
    None yet :). Converting mockups to site designs is already one of my skillsets.

  * What has been easy?
    Everything. :)

  * What has been difficult?
    Not really difficult, but I did have to lookup the HTML element for strikethrough. Can't think of the last time I had to use it.

  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
    I used a web search to find out about the <s> element that took me to the MDN wiki.
